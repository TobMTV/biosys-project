\begin{frame} \frametitle{Conclusions}

	It wasn't an easy project, but we did our best. At the end of it all, we 
	learned:
	\vfill
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How to gather information on standards and OS solutions available.
		\item Deploy an actual service relying on ourselves.
		\item How to evaluate a BS performance in an automatic way.
	\end{itemize}
	\vfill
	The software that we used was clearly designed to minimize the False 
	Acceptance Rate penalizing the False Rejection Rate, but overall it 
	was simple to understand and simple to use compared to other solutions.
