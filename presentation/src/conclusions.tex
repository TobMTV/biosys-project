	It wasn't an easy project, but we did our best. At the end of it all, we 
	learned:
	\vfill
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How to gather information on standards and OS solutions available.
		\item Deploy an actual service relying on ourselves.
		\item How to evaluate a BS performance in an automatic way.
	\end{itemize}
	\vfill
	Performance consideration here.
